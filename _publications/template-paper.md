Can you find me? By simulating how humans to discoverthe so-called ‘perfectly’ camouflaged object, we present a
novel boundary-guided separated attention network (callBSA-Net). Beyond the existing camouflaged object detection
(COD) wisdom, BSA-Net utilizes two-stream separated attention modules to highlight the separator (or say the camouflaged object’s boundary) between an image’s background and foreground: the reverse attention stream helps erase the camouflaged object’s interior to focus on the background,while the normal attention stream recovers the interior and thus pay more attention to the foreground; and both streams are followed by a boundary guider module and combined to strengthen the understanding of the boundary.
